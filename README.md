## A cool moon for Lethal Company, inspired by New Jersey from Tony Hawk's Underground, mixed with some aethetics from Unreal Tournament 1999

Why did I make this? For me and my buddies to have an area for dance battles, relaxing conversations on the bridge, and some nostalgia.
This mod will be available on Thunderstore as well, and it will also be featured in the BungusModpack alongside the rest of my mods.
